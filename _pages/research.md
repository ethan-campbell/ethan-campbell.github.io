The ice-covered Southern Ocean around Antarctica is a dynamic region, featuring substantial variability in seasonal ice cover as well as heat, salt, and biogeochemical fluxes. My research is focused on its role in global climate.

I am most interested in air-ice-ocean interactions, offshore polynyas, and bottom water formation. The primary tools I use in my research are under-ice hydrographic measurements, remote sensing, and atmospheric reanalysis.

## Offshore polynyas in the Weddell Sea

* **The periodic appearance of large sea ice openings, known as polynyas, offshore of the Antarctic coast has been an enduring mystery in polar oceanography.** In [Campbell et al. (2019)](/publications/) in *Nature* (see also [Swart et al. 2018](/publications/) in *BAMS*), we try to explain why polynyas form near the Maud Rise seamount in the Weddell Sea in some years but not others. Two [SOCCOM Project](https://soccom.princeton.edu) biogeochemical profiling floats were present during the unexpected [2016 and 2017 polynya events](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/88656/a-polynya-seldom-seen) and collected measurements that suggest reduced haline stratification preconditioned the appearance of the polynyas, which were sustained by deep overturning (note that these are the first *in situ* observations of this phenomenon). We use these float observations and a variety of other data sources to show that storms were the proximal trigger of the recent openings. It turns out that both increased storminess and reduced upper-ocean stability are favored by positive fluctuations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which we identify as a common factor in the 2016-2017 events as well as past polynyas near Maud Rise. The long-term increasing trend in SAM raises questions about whether this effect will win out over simultaneous trends towards greater stratification of the Southern Ocean, which would tend to prohibit polynya occurrences.

* **The Weddell Sea is more susceptible to destabilization and polynya formation than other sectors of the Southern Ocean.** In [Wilson et al. (2019)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0184.1) in *JPO*, we highlight the regional variability in ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks within the seasonal ice zone, which affect the growth of sea ice and release of heat during winter. Idealized 1-D model simulations show that, to a large extent, ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks also determine the sensitivity of the upper ocean&ndash;sea ice system to strong wind-mixing events.

* **Many questions remain unanswered.** Future investigation will need to provide a more detailed assessment of how convection during the 2016-2017 polynyas modified deep ocean properties, as well as the mechanisms by which winter storms may perturb the upper ocean under sea ice.

## Ongoing and future work

The following are several projects that I have been working on (or just thinking about!). Of course, not all of these will happen in the next few years of my PhD. [Contact me](mailto:ethancc@uw.edu) if any of these sound interesting or if you are engaged in similar research. I would be excited to collaborate!

* Impact of storms on the upper ocean under sea ice
* Reconstruction of sea ice formation and melt from ocean salinity
* Changes in Southern Hemisphere subpolar gyre strength under anthropogenic forcing
* Effects of Taylor column dynamics on mixing and ventilation
* Pathways of Antarctic Bottom Water formation during glacial climates
* Influence of offshore deep convection on records from Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Sites 689 and 690 at Maud Rise
