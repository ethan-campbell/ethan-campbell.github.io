The ice-covered Southern Ocean around Antarctica is a dynamic region that plays a key role in global climate. It is characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variability in heat, salt, and biogeochemical fluxes.

My research focuses on several processes within this region: air-ice-ocean interactions, offshore polynyas, and ventilation of deep waters (i.e. heat and gas exchange). The primary tools I have used in my research are under-ice hydrographic measurements, remote sensing, and atmospheric reanalysis.

## Offshore polynyas in the Weddell Sea

* **The periodic appearance of large sea ice openings, known as polynyas, offshore of the Antarctic coast has been an enduring mystery in polar oceanography.** In [Campbell et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1294-0) in *Nature* (see also [Swart et al. 2018](/publications/) in *BAMS*), we try to explain why polynyas form near the Maud Rise seamount in the Weddell Sea in some years but not others. Two [SOCCOM Project](https://soccom.princeton.edu) biogeochemical profiling floats were present during the unexpected [2016 and 2017 polynya events](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/88656/a-polynya-seldom-seen) and collected measurements that suggest reduced haline stratification preconditioned the appearance of the polynyas, which were sustained by deep overturning. Note that these are the first *in situ* observations of this phenomenon in an offshore polynya. Using these and a variety of other data sources, we show that storms were the proximal trigger of the recent openings. Both increased storminess and reduced upper-ocean stability in the eastern Weddell Sea region are favored by positive fluctuations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which we identify as a common factor in the 2016-2017 events as well as past polynyas near Maud Rise. The long-term increasing trend in SAM raises questions of whether this effect will win out over the simultaneous trend toward a more stratified Southern Ocean, which would tend to limit polynya occurrences.

* **The Weddell Sea is more susceptible to destabilization and polynya formation than other sectors of the Southern Ocean.** In [Wilson et al. (2019)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0184.1) in *JPO*, we highlight the regional variability in ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks within the seasonal ice zone, which affect the growth of sea ice and release of heat during winter. Idealized 1-D model simulations show that, to a large extent, ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks also determine the sensitivity of the upper ocean&ndash;sea ice system to strong wind-mixing events.

## Ongoing and future work

The following are several projects that I have been actively working on (or just thinking about!). Of course, not all of these will be completed in the next few years of my PhD. [Contact me](mailto:ethancc@uw.edu) if any of these sound interesting or if you are engaged in similar research. I would be excited to collaborate!

* Reconstruction of Antarctic sea ice formation and melt from ocean salinity
* Impact of storms on the upper ocean under sea ice
* Effects of Taylor column dynamics on mixing, deep ventilation, and biogeochemistry
* Changes in Southern Hemisphere subpolar gyre strength under anthropogenic forcing
* Pathways of Antarctic Bottom Water formation during glacial climates
* Influence of offshore deep convection on records from Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Sites 689 and 690 at Maud Rise
