## I am a physical oceanographer studying the sea ice and ocean around Antarctica.

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu) at University of Washington in Seattle, WA, advised by [Stephen Riser](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/stephen-riser/) and funded by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship.

My research primarily uses observations of the ocean to develop a better understanding of air-ice-ocean interactions, offshore polynyas, and ventilation processes around Antarctica, as well as their role in global climate.

* **May 2019**: I attended the [ECCO Summer School](https://www.eccosummerschool.org) at Friday Harbor Labs on San Juan Island, WA. Thanks to the organizers for a wonderfully stimulating two weeks!

* **April 2019**: The third annual UW Program on Climate Change (PCC) Spring Symposium, organized by myself and other members of the PCC [Graduate Student Steering Committee](https://pcc.uw.edu/people/graduate-student-steering-committee/), was a great success. Read about the event [here](https://pcc.uw.edu/blog/2019/05/09/the-third-annual-spring-symposium-was-held-on-april-27-2019/).

* **February 2019**: A new paper led by [Earle Wilson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UHSYElEAAAAJ&hl=en) at UW, titled "[Winter upper-ocean stability and ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks in the sea ice&ndash;covered Southern Ocean](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0184.1)," is out in *Journal of Physical Oceanography*. For more details on our study, see [Research](/research/).

* **January 2019**: Over the next few months, I will be presenting [live shows](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/events/planetarium-polar-300/) on polar oceanography in the Willard Smith Planetarium at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. This opportunity is thanks to PacSci's [Science Communication Fellowship](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/fellowship/).
