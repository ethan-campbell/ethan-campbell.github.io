# I am an oceanographer studying Antarctic ocean, sea ice, and snow physics.

<hr style="height:0.5px; visibility:hidden;" />

I am currently an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Polar Science Center](https://psc.apl.uw.edu) at the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory in Seattle, WA, working with [Melinda Webster](https://psc.apl.uw.edu/people/investigators/melinda-webster/) and [Edward Blanchard-Wrigglesworth](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/edward-blanchard-wrigglesworth/). I received my Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the University of Washington's School of Oceanography.

[My research](/research/) uses autonomous ocean measurements and modeling to develop a better understanding of processes involving sea ice and snow around Antarctica. The focus of my postdoctoral work is how storms and snowfall affect heat and freshwater fluxes in the ice-covered Southern Ocean as well as the future trajectory of Antarctic sea ice.

## Recent news

* **January 2025**: I am excited to be joining the University of Washington's [Applied Physics Laboratory](https://apl.uw.edu) as a postdoctoral researcher, supported by fellowships from the [National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/postdoctoral-awardees) (2025--2026) and the [Washington Research Foundation](https://www.wrfseattle.org/news/washington-research-foundation-awards-12-three-year-postdoctoral-fellowships/) (starting in October 2025).

* **December 2024**: I defended my dissertation, titled "Constraining Antarctic polynya formation and sea ice and snow evolution using autonomous observations and modeling." Thank you to all those who supported me throughout graduate school---especially my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. [Stephen Riser](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/stephen-riser/).

* **August 2024**: Our paper titled "Cracking the code: An evidence-based approach to teaching Python in an undergraduate earth science setting" is now [published](https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2024.2384338) in *Journal of Geoscience Education*. In this mixed-methods study, co-led with [Katy Christensen](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/katy-christensen), we make a case for the importance of project-based instruction and an accessible classroom environment focused on active learning. We hope the paper and our [class resources](https://ethan-campbell.github.io/OCEAN_215/) are useful for those teaching or developing introductory scientific programming courses. Recorded lessons and other materials are all available for reuse.

* **August 2023**: I gave a plenary talk at the SOOS Symposium in Hobart on "Sailing towards a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Southern Ocean Observing System: Challenges and opportunities." The slides are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_CDwI-qF09X2aAW4m-DACyvHacmdXtz1/view?usp=share_link). I am also proud to have received an Honorable Mention award (2nd place among early career researcher talks) for my presentation on "Antarctic sea ice formation and melt rates estimated from under-ice Argo observations."

* **September 2022**: At the UW Program on Climate Change's Summer Institute on "Pathways to Net sZero" in Friday Harbor, WA, I presented a [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i8ZHOGYXqMWO0tGKttS80YHMbWj5oVN6/view?usp=sharing) on "Pushing Seattle towards net zero: Opportunities for local advocacy and engagement."

* **February 2022**: At the AGU Fall Meeting in December, Katy Christensen and I virtually presented a retrospective [study](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/998855) of our redesign of OCEAN 215, our department's introductory Python course (see our [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVnXeqSyAi4VCX5e1NwL0gk_QMHr6bHo/view?usp=sharing) here). We just learned that we received an [Outstanding Student Presentation Award](https://connect.agu.org/education/honors/educationsectionospa)!

* **January 2021**: I was selected for a three-year term as the [APECS representative](https://www.apecs.is/who-we-are/representatives.html) to the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) [Weddell Seaâ€“Dronning Maud Land Regional Working Group](http://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/wsdml). The RWG is a multinational body that aims to coordinate observations and science in this interesting region of the Southern Ocean.

* **December 2020**: [Katy Christensen](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Katy%20Christensen) and I finished co-teaching OCEAN 215, an introductory Python data analysis course. We adopted a flipped, virtual format and redesigned the course to incorporate a variety of evidence-based teaching practices. Our course website can be accessed [at this link](https://ethan-campbell.github.io/OCEAN_215/). All recorded lessons and other materials are available for reuse.

* **May 2020**: A new paper led by [Lauren von Berg](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/22/lauren-von-berg-class-2020-publishes-research-internship-studying-antarctic-sea-ice) at Princeton and [Channing Prend](https://cprend.github.io) at SIO, titled "[Weddell Sea phytoplankton blooms modulated by sea ice variability and polynya formation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL087954)," is now out in *Geophysical Research Letters*. For more details on our study, see [Research](/research/).

* **February 2020**: I'll be presenting [new work](https://agu.confex.com/agu/osm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/657323) on Antarctic sea ice growth and melt reconstructions using under-ice ocean observations at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego on February 21.

* **September 2019**: I discussed Weddell Sea polynyas with Dan Jones from BAS on his podcast, "Climate Scientists." Listen [here](https://anchor.fm/climate-scientists/episodes/Ethan-Campbell-e52ogj).

* **August 2019**: I'll be speaking about Weddell Sea polynyas at the [IGS](https://www.igsoc.org) Sea Ice Symposium in Winnipeg on August 23 and at the NYU Courant [AOS Colloquium](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/calendars/seminars/atmosphere-ocean-science-colloquium/) in New York on September 4.

* **June 2019**: My first paper as lead author, titled "[Antarctic offshore polynyas linked to Southern Hemisphere climate anomalies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1294-0)," is out in *Nature*. See [Research](/research/) for a summary of this study and [Publications](/publications/) for links to media coverage.

* **April 2019**: The third annual UW Program on Climate Change (PCC) Spring Symposium was organized by myself and other members of the PCC [Graduate Student Steering Committee](https://pcc.uw.edu/people/graduate-student-steering-committee/).

For more details on our study, see [Research](/research/).

* **January 2019**: Throughout the next year, I will be presenting [live shows](https://pacificsciencecenter.org/visit/planetarium/) on polar oceanography in the Willard Smith Planetarium at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. This opportunity is thanks to PacSci's Science Communication Fellowship.
