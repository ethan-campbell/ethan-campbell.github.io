## I am a physical oceanographer studying the sea ice and ocean around Antarctica.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Oceanography](https://www.ocean.washington.edu) at University of Washington in Seattle, WA, advised by [Stephen Riser](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/stephen-riser/). I am funded by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship from 2017-2021.

The focus of my research is using observations of the ice-covered Southern Ocean to develop a better understanding of sea ice processes and offshore polynyas around Antarctica, as well as their role in global climate.

## Recent news

* **February 2022**: At the AGU Fall Meeting in December, Katy Christensen and I virtually presented a retrospective study of our redesign of OCEAN 215, our department's introductory Python course; here is our [abstract](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/998855) and [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u4c5tIvcFms4IAnmtk0cwTh1N3DCx3xo/view?usp=sharing). We just learned that we received an Outstanding Student Presentation Award! Stay tuned for a forthcoming paper on our work...

* **January 2021**: I was selected for a two-year term as the [APECS](https://apecs.is) representative to the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) [Weddell Seaâ€“Dronning Maud Land Regional Working Group](http://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/wsdml). The RWG is a multinational body that aims to coordinate observations and science in this interesting region of the Southern Ocean.

* **December 2020**: [Katy Christensen](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Katy%20Christensen) and I finished co-teaching OCEAN 215, an introductory Python data analysis course. We adopted a flipped, virtual format and redesigned the course to incorporate a variety of evidence-based teaching practices. Our course website can be accessed [at this link](https://ethan-campbell.github.io/OCEAN_215/); all recorded lessons and other materials are available for reuse.

* **May 2020**: A new paper led by [Lauren von Berg](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/22/lauren-von-berg-class-2020-publishes-research-internship-studying-antarctic-sea-ice) at Princeton and [Channing Prend](https://cprend.github.io) at SIO, titled "[Weddell Sea phytoplankton blooms modulated by sea ice variability and polynya formation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL087954)," is now out in *Geophysical Research Letters*. For more details on our study, see [Research](/research/).

* **February 2020**: I'll be presenting [new work](https://agu.confex.com/agu/osm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/657323) on Antarctic sea ice growth and melt reconstructions using under-ice ocean observations at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego on February 21.

* **September 2019**: I discussed Weddell Sea polynyas with Dan Jones from BAS on his podcast, "Climate Scientists." Listen [here](https://anchor.fm/climate-scientists/episodes/Ethan-Campbell-e52ogj).

* **August 2019**: I'll be speaking about Weddell Sea polynyas at the [IGS Sea Ice Symposium](http://www.igswpg.com) in Winnipeg on August 23 and at the NYU Courant [AOS Colloquium](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/calendars/seminars/atmosphere-ocean-science-colloquium/) in New York on September 4.

* **June 2019**: My first paper as lead author, titled "[Antarctic offshore polynyas linked to Southern Hemisphere climate anomalies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1294-0)," is out in *Nature*. See [Research](/research/) for a summary of this study and [Publications](/publications/) for links to media coverage.

* **April 2019**: The third annual UW Program on Climate Change (PCC) Spring Symposium was organized by myself and other members of the PCC [Graduate Student Steering Committee](https://pcc.uw.edu/people/graduate-student-steering-committee/). Read my PCC blog post about the event [here](https://pcc.uw.edu/blog/2019/05/09/the-third-annual-spring-symposium-was-held-on-april-27-2019/).

* **February 2019**: A new paper led by [Earle Wilson](https://earlew.github.io) at UW, titled "[Winter upper-ocean stability and ice&ndash;ocean feedbacks in the sea ice&ndash;covered Southern Ocean](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0184.1)," is out in *Journal of Physical Oceanography*. For more details on our study, see [Research](/research/).

* **January 2019**: Over the next few months, I will be presenting [live shows](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/events/planetarium-polar-300/) on polar oceanography in the Willard Smith Planetarium at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. This opportunity is thanks to PacSci's [Science Communication Fellowship](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/fellowship/).
